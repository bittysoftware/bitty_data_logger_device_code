# CO2 Monitoring - User Code Capture Mode

This script allows Bitty Data Logger to capture carbon dioxide level readings from a Cozir CO2 sensor.

See https://bittysoftware.blogspot.com/2018/07/c02-monitoring-with-bbc-microbit-and.html 

Uses the Bluetooth and Let's Talk Science extensions.

Status: generates micro:bit error 0x02 (out of memory). It may be that one of the libraries has grown since the original CO2 monitoring code was written and demonstrated here: https://youtu.be/1Wz1_5ox3KM 

Options: Take only the code needed from the Cozir library and try to optimise.
