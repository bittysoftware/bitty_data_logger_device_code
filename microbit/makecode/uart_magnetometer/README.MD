# Magnetometer Data - User Code Capture Mode

This script allows Bitty Data Logger to capture magnetometer data in user code capture mode. Your microbit code is responsible for magnetometer sampling and for using the Bluetooth UART service to send your data in the correct format to a connected device which is running Bitty Data Logger. This can be either the smartphone application or the web application in BittyWeb (https://www.bittysoftware.com/bittyweb/).
